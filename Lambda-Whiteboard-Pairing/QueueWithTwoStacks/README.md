# Implement a Queue with Two Stacks

Given two Stack instances (i.e. Stacks exhibit LIFO ordering and only have access to the methods `push` and `pop`), implement a Queue data structure with the methods `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `peek` (returns the same result as calling `dequeue` but doesn't change the queue). Your Queue should of course exhibit FIFO ordering. 

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
