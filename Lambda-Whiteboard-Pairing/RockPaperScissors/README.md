# Rock Paper Scissors

Write a function called `rockPaperScissors` that will take as input an integer `n`. Your function should output all of the possible combinations of the three plays 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' up to the given integer `n`. 

For example, for `n = 2`, your function should output: 
```
[[rock, rock], [rock, paper], [rock, scissors],
 [paper, rock], [paper, paper], [paper, scissors], [scissors, rock],
 [scissors, paper], [scissors, scissors]]
```

So your output should be an array of arrays, where the length of each inner array is `n`.
